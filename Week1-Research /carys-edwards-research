Suggested game ideas: 

- Classic Helicopter Game - https://www.crazygames.com/game/helicopter 
  "In this game, the player travels further and further into a procedurally-generated never ending landscape
  and must avoid crashing into floating obstacles and walls, both of which end the game if impacted."

- Pong game - https://ponggame.io 
 "One of the first computer games ever created.The original pong consisted of two paddles that players used to 
 volley a small ball back and forth across a screen."
  - Variants: Several of the same variations found in Arkanoid can be used in Pong. 
              Obstacles can be placed on the map instead of just an open field.
 The Twist

Jumping up platforms   
"Platforms will begin falling from the sky. Our character will start falling too, and the only way to stay 
alive will be to keep jumping from one platform to another. The longer we last, the higher our score!"
