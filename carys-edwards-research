Group 13 Game Discussion and Ideas: 

Carys Edwards: 
3 games I like to play in my free time: 
- Mario Kart 
- Animal Crossing
- Stardew Valley 

Suggested game ideas: 

- Classic Helicopter Game - https://www.crazygames.com/game/helicopter 
  "In this game, the player travels further and further into a procedurally-generated never ending landscape
  and must avoid crashing into floating obstacles and walls, both of which end the game if impacted."
  - Many variations of the game like Flappy Bird and Crossy Road
